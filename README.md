**<WORK IN PROGRESS, I'D ACTUALLY PREFER TO SOLVE NEW PROBLEMS, THE PURPOSE OF THIS REPO IS JUST TO SHOW OFF A BIT>**<br><br>
This repository contains solutions to algorithmic problems I've solved.<br>
Isn't it obvious that you shouldn't check them out if you want to solve them yourself? (I namedd the source files in such a way that you should be able to find the statement, more about that below)<br>
Links to websites with problem statements and online judge software can be found in the source code files.<br>
Each file's name follows the A-B-C format:<ul>
	<li>A - contest/website's name:</li><ul>
		<li>oi - Polish Olympiad in Informatics (Olimpiada Informatyczna)</li>
		<li>cf - CodeForces</li>
		<li>_(to be expanded)_</li></ul>
	<li>B - problem number/stage</li>
	<li>C - problem's proper name</li>
</ul>
