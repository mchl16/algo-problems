This repository contains solutions to algorithmic problems I've solved.<br>
Isn't it obvious that you shouldn't check them out if you want to solve them yourself? <br>
Links to websites with problem statements and online judge software can be found in the source code files.<br>
Each file's name follows the A-B-C format, where:<br>
	&ensp;A - contest/website's name:<br>
		&ensp;&ensp;oi - Polish Olympiad in Informatics (Olimpiada Informatyczna)<br>
		&ensp;&ensp;cf - CodeForces<br>
		&ensp;&ensp;_<to be expanded>_<br>
