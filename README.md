**<WORK IN PROGRESS, I'D ACTUALLY PREFER TO SOLVE PROBLEMS THAN SUBMIT THEIR SOLUTIONS HERE, THE PURPOSE OF THIS REPO IS JUST TO SHOW OFF A BIT>**<br><br>
This repository contains solutions to algorithmic problems I've solved.<br>
Isn't it obvious that you shouldn't check them out if you want to solve them yourself? (I namedd the source files in such a way that you should be able to find the statement, more about that below)<br>
Links to websites with problem statements and online judge software can be found in the source code files.<br>
Each file's name follows the A-B-C format, where:<br>
		&ensp;A - contest/website's name:<br>
		&ensp;&ensp;oi - Polish Olympiad in Informatics (Olimpiada Informatyczna)<br>
		&ensp;&ensp;cf - CodeForces<br>
		&ensp;&ensp;_<to be expanded>_<br>
	&ensp;B - problem number/stage<br>
	&ensp;C - problem's proper name<br>
